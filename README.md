# Fake-News-Detection

Detecting fake news in Python using Jupyter Notebook involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. Here's a high-level description of the steps you can follow:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a dataset of news articles labeled as either real or fake. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle or build your own.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Perform text preprocessing on the news articles, which includes tasks like tokenization, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common methods include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a machine learning or deep learning model for fake news detection. Popular choices include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Naive Bayes
     - Random Forest
     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Transformer-based models like BERT.

5. **Training the Model**:
   - Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the selected model on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix on the testing data.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

8. **Deployment**:
   - If you want to use your model in real-world applications, you can deploy it as a web application or API.

9. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance in a real-world environment and retrain it as needed to maintain accuracy.

Here's a simplified Python code snippet for a basic fake news detection model using the TF-IDF vectorizer and a Logistic Regression classifier in a Jupyter Notebook:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load your dataset (assuming you have a 'text' column for news content and a 'label' column for real/fake labels)
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Data preprocessing
# ...

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['text'], data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# TF-IDF vectorization
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(report)
```

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load your dataset (assuming you have a 'text' column for news content and a 'label' column for real/fake labels)
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Data preprocessing
# ...

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['text'], data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# TF-IDF vectorization
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(report)
